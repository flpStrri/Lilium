# Introduction

Hello! Are you here to help on Lilium? Awesome, feel welcome and read the following sections in order to know how to ask questions and how to help us make this software better.

All members of our community are expected to follow our [Code of Conduct][CodeOfConduct]. Please make sure you are welcoming and friendly in all of our spaces.

Lilium is an open source project and we love to receive contributions from our community — you! There are many ways to contribute, from writing tutorials or blog posts using the boilerplate, improving the documentation, submitting bug reports and feature requests or writing code which can be incorporated into Lilium boilerplate itself.

Please, don't use the issue tracker for *support questions* about the stack being used. Check Stack Overflow and cominities Gitter and Slack.

# Ground Rules

* Ensure the code is always working with the latest Node.js stable version available for AWS Lambda Functions.
* Create issues for any major changes and enhancements that you wish to make. Discuss things transparently and get community feedback.
* Make the best you can to put one and only one feature in one Pull Request.
* Keep feature versions as small as possible, preferably one new feature per version.
* Be welcoming to newcomers and encourage diverse new contributors from all backgrounds. See the [Code of Conduct][CodeOfConduct].

# Your First Contribution

Unsure where to begin contributing? You can start by looking through these `good-first-issue` and `help-wanted` issues:
ents is a reasonable proxy for impact a given change will have.

Also, you can learn a lot from the community if you are a new to open source at https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/ and https://www.firsttimersonly.com

**At this point, you're ready to make your changes!** Feel free to ask for help; everyone is a beginner at first :pray:

*PS. If a maintainer asks you to "rebase" your PR, they're saying that a lot of code has changed, and that you need to update your branch so it's easier to merge.*

# How to report a bug

If you find a security vulnerability, do NOT open an issue. Email https://github.com/flpStrri instead.

In order to determine whether you are dealing with a security issue, ask yourself these two questions:
* Can I access something that's not mine, or something I shouldn't have access to?
* Can I disable something for other people?
If the answer to either of those two questions are "yes", then you're probably dealing with a security issue. Note that even if you answer "no" to both questions, you may still be dealing with a security issue, so if you're unsure, just email him.

If you are not filing a security vulnerability issue, just follow the [bug report issue template](https://github.com/flpStrri/Lilium/issues/new?template=bug_report.md).


# How to suggest a feature or enhancement

If you find yourself wishing for a feature that is not into our [running projects](https://github.com/flpStrri/Lilium/projects), you are probably not alone. There are bound to be others out there with similar needs — we hope. First search on the issues page for it and give a :thumbsup: and a comment, if neede, to explain your point of view on that request. If you are — absolutely — sure the is nothing similar open an issue following the [feature request issue template](https://github.com/flpStrri/Lilium/issues/new?template=feature_request.md)..


# Code review process
- The core team looks at Pull Requests on a weekly basis.
- After feedback has been given we expect responses within two weeks. After two weeks we may close the pull request if it isn't showing any activity.
